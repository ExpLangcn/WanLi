# Submitting Nuclei Templates üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª

Below you will find the process and workflow used to review and merge your changes.

## Step 1 : Find existing templates

- Take a look at the [Existing Templates](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates) before creating new one.
- Take a look at Existing Templates in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/issues) and [Pull Request](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/pulls) section to avoid duplicate work.
- Take a look at [Templates](https://nuclei.projectdiscovery.io/templating-guide/) and [Matchers](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/wiki/Unique-Template-Matchers) Guideline for creating new template.

## Step 2 : Fork the Project

- Fork this Repository. This will create a Local Copy of this Repository on your Github Profile. Keep a reference to the original project in `upstream` remote.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/nuclei-templates
cd nuclei-templates
git remote add upstream https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates
```

- If you have already forked the project, update your copy before working.

```sh
git remote update
git checkout master
git rebase upstream/master
```

## Step 3 : Create your Template Branch

Create a new branch. Use its name to identify the issue your addressing.

```sh
# It will create a new branch with name template_branch_name and switch to that branch
git checkout -b template_branch_name
```

## Step 4 : Create Template and Commit
- Create your template.
- Add all the files/folders needed.
- After you've made changes or completed template creation, add changes to the branch you've just created by:

```sh
# To add all new files to branch template_branch_name
git add .
```

- To commit, give a descriptive message for the convenience of the reviewer by:

```sh
# This message get associated with all files you have changed
git commit -m "Added/Fixed/Updated XXX Template"
```

**NOTE**:

- A Pull Request should have only one unique template to make it simple for review.
- Multiple templates for same technology can be grouped into single Pull Request. 


## Step 5 : Push Your Changes

- Now you are ready to push your template to the remote (forked) repository.
- When your work is ready and complies with the project conventions, upload your changes to your fork:

```sh
# To push your work to your remote repository
git push -u origin template_branch_name
```

## Step 6 : Pull Request

- Fire up your favorite browser, navigate to your GitHub repository, then click on the New pull request button within the Pull requests tab. Provide a meaningful name and description to your pull request, that describes the purpose of the template.
- Voila! Your Pull Request has been submitted. It will be reviewed and merged by the moderators, if it complies with project standards, otherwise a feedback will be provided.ü•≥

## Tip from usüòá

- **Nuclei** outcomes are only as excellent as **template matchersüí°**
- Declare at least two matchers to reduce false positive
- Avoid matching words reflected in the URL to reduce false positive
- Avoid short word that could be encountered anywhere
